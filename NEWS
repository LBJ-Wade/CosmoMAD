(v1.0)  Fixed computation of growth factor and growth rate for varying
	dark energy equation of state.
(v0.10) Arbitrary number of multipoles enabled.
	Added minimal support for mass function calculations.
	NEW PYTHON WRAPPER (see python_ext).
(v0.9) Added some mass-function support
(v0.8) Slight change to csm_set_linear_pk (see ChangeLog)
(v0.7) Implemented faster calculation of the spherical Bessel functions.
(v0.6) Added support for shared libraries and doxygen documentation.
(v0.5) New functionality added through the Csm_params class. See the
ChangeLog for more details. w0-wa cosmologies now supported. Constant
linear bias implemented.
(v0.4) New functions added. CosmoMad now supports the Eisenstein & Hu
parametrizations for the power spectrum. A different option for the
calculation of the anisotropic correlation function has been provided.
(v0.3) The integral for xi(r) has been further improved. It uses an
approximation to the Bessel functions for large arguments (x>100) which
accelerates the calculation of xi for large scales.
(v0.2) The integral for xi(r) has been improved to yield the exact
result on small scales.
(v0.1) A bug regarding the normalization of the nonlinear P_k was fixed
(see ChangeLog)
