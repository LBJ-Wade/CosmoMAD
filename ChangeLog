	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_growth_factor,csm_f_growth) : Added support
	for varying DE equation of state.

2014-04-11  David Alonso  <david.alonso@uam.es>

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_set_Pk_params,csm_Pk_full): Added
	support for damping terms in Pk to reproduce non-linear redshift
	distortions and Gaussian photometric redshifts. This implied
	enabling the code to calculate an arbitrary number of power
	spectrum multipoles.

2013-12-21  David Alonso  <david.alonso@uam.es>

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_M2R,csm_R2M,csm_collapsed_fraction): Added
	support to calculate some mass-function-related stuff. Namely
	we can calculate the collapsed fraction F(<M) for three different
	mass function parametrizations.

2013-11-22  David Alonso  <david.alonso@uam.es>

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_set_linear_pk): Previously the P_k was always
	normalized to the sigma_8 given as the s8 argument in this
	function. Now, if s8<=0, the original value of sigma_8 is
	preserved. Note that this only makes sense for power spectra read
	from a CAMB file, since BBKS of EH power spectra are not
	normalized (i.e. we only use the transfer function).

2013-11-20  David Alonso <david.alonso@uam.es>
	* bessel.c: Implemented faster calculation of the spherical
	Bessel functions. Negligibly less accurate than GSL, but
	much faster. Based on the method used by CAMB and CMBFAST
	- in fact it's almost a direct translation of the Fortran
	code. The GSL functions are still supported, but their use
	must be triggered by using the flag -D_USE_GSL_BESSEL when
	compiling the library (add it to CPPFLAGS).

2013-10-10  David Alonso <david.alonso@uam.es>
	* libshr/: Support added for shared libraries.
	* docs/: Doxygen documentation page implemented.

	* cosmo_mad.c (Csm_params): The whole library has been changed
	by defining the class Csm_params, which contains all the
	information about a given cosmological model. The first argument
	of all functions must now be a Csm_params variable. This avoids
	the use of global variables and allows for the simultaneous
	calculation of quantities in different cosmological models.

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_background_set): CosmoMad can now calculate
	observables in w0-wa cosmological models.

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_set_Pk_params): Constant linear bias now
	supported.

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_Pk_nonlinear): The function csm_Pk_nonlinear_0
	has been changed to csm_Pk_nonlinear, which returns the non-linear
	power spectrum scaled with the growth factor given in
	csm_set_Pk_params, but without any bias or RSDs.

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_set_xi_multipole_splines): This function now
	uses a specific set of scales for the splines. See details in the
	documentation.

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_unset_xi_multipole_splines): undoes 
	csm_set_xi_multipole_splines.

	
2013-02-05  David Alonso  <david.alonso@uam.es>

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_hubble): new function added returning the
	inverse Hubble horizon in length units.

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_set_linear_pk): new option added to calculate
	the power spectrum using the Eisenstein & Hu transfer function
	with and without acoustic oscillation.

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_set_nonlinear_pk): new option added to
	calculate the non-linear power spectrum using RPT and still
	recover the small-scale regime by adding the Eisenstein & Hu
	wiggle-less power spectrum.

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_Pk_nonlinear_0): a bug has been fixed that gave
	the wrong large-k behavior.

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_xi_pi_sigma): new function added to calculate
	the anisotropic correlation function using longitudinal/transverse
	coordinates. This can be done either through the previously used
	multipole expansion or through an exact (but slow) double
	integral.

2013-01-25  David Alonso  <david.alonso@uam.es>

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_xi_multipole,csm_xi2p_L): the integrals that
	define these two functions have been improved. An approximation
	to the Bessel functions for large arguments (x>100) is used which
	accelerates the calculation on large scales. No window function
	at all is needed anymore.


2013-01-21  David Alonso  <david.alonso@uam.es>

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_xi_multipole): in previous versions a top-hat
	window function of scale 5 Mpc/h was needed for the integral to
	converge when using HALOFIT's Pk. This has now been improved and
	the window function is no longer needed on scales r<10 Mpc/h, and
	a smaller window (R = 1 Mpc/h) is used above that scale to reduce
	the highly oscillatory nature of the Bessel functions with
	argument k*r. It has been tested that using this smoothing scale
	(1 Mpc/h) doesn't change the results at large scales.


2013-01-15  David Alonso  <david.alonso@uam.es>

	* cosmo_mad.c (csm_set_nonlinear_Pk): the linear Pk is normalized
	to the user-defined sigma_8, but the non-linear Pk coming from
	HALOFIT wasn't in version 0.0. This is now fixed, although, to
	obtain correct results, the linear and non-linear Pk files must
	have been obtained from CAMB using the SAME parameters.

2013-01-14  David Alonso  <david.alonso@uam.es>

	* cosmo_mad.c : CosmoMad is born
